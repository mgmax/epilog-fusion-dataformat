eView Camera protocol:
- UDP Broadcast for IP and Port of camera unit
- TCP something to fetch image
  (-> see eview-camera-process-pcap-capture.py for a first rough attempt at reverse engineering)
- OpenCV for color conversion, stitching, marker detection etc.


Epilog Fusion printer language, compared to Legend:
- Autofocus command is different
- Frequency: \x1b&y50R (Fusion, now in percent)  compared to Helix: \x1b&y2480R  (in 0-5000 range)
- cutting paths: The Job Manager (not the Normal windows printer driver) converts (approximates) polylines to Bezier curves, using the appropriate HPGL command, so that the motion is faster and less jerky.
- new "PowerComp" / "SpeedComp" settings
 
The guys at Epilog are quite helpful regarding questions about the commands.
